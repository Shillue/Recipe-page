## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I was able to recap the semantic markup of HTML and CSS, as well as responsiveness.

### Continued development

Therefore, I will focus more on writing semantic HTML and CSS as well as Flexbox and making pages more responsive.
